# SimpleCalculator

A project created with beginner level HTML, CSS, and JS.

This was my planning process throughout the project:  

- Split the calc layout into two halves: screen-level and button-panels
- Create separate containers with their components for each half
- Position everything to my liking in CSS
- Create functions for simple math functionality
- Add in mouse and keyboard handlers

Bugs/Issues during the project:

- fill when needed
- filler
